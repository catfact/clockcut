# clockcut

simple demonstrationÂ of clocked looping / delay with `softcut` on norns

## usage

at present, the demo has no interactive UI. it exposes parameters which are designed for MIDI mapping.

## parameters

- `clock_mul`: multiplied by the clock beat duration to yield loop duration

- `speed_ratio`: speed of the virtual tape, as a ratio

- `speed_tune`: speed tuning offset, in cents

- `rec_level`: level at which input is written to the buffer

- `pre_level`: level at which existing buffer contents are preserved

- `fade_ms`: crossfade duration in milliseconds

## TODO:

- raw midi clock mode (handle PPQ ticks directly)
- finish/test EQ abstraction
- trigger params to reset, clear, etc
- more voices?
- duration sequences
- position sequences?
- more UI? (show phase?)
